# Customers-segmentation
To understand customers better and offer them products and services that suit them

Project description: This project aims at understanding customer’s preferences and reasons why they churn. A good understanding of why they leave a product or company will help to provide tailored products and services that better suit them so that they can stay with the brand. To achieve this, customers will be grouped into different segments using by their common habits (churn/ not churn).

Project architecture: machine learning techniques will be used to identify the various clusters of customers while matplotlib and seaborn will be used for visualization of the result. Some features like age profile, length of contract, monthly charges and a few others will be analyzed to verify if they are key factors to a customer’s decision.

Data source: The data was provided by BT as a similar version to what is used.
